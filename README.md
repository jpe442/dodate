About

Do Date is a new envisioning of the todo list application loosely inspired by Kanban boards. In contrast to the traditional list-based todo app, Do Date allows the user to organize their todo items across the work week. This way the user can easily plot out 'when' is the ideal time to work based on 'what' the work is and 'how long' the work might take. 

The primary user-view features an interactive Monday-Sunday calendar of the current week where users organize their todos by simply dragging them around and dropping them where they would like. New todos are created from a new todo form, where they can then be immediately placed onto a responsive side-page that holds unscheduled items or directly onto an open space of the calendar.
