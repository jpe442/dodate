Do Date is a new envisioning of the to do list application for aggressive. In contrast to the traditional list-based to-do app, Do Date allows the user to organize their to-do items for an entire week. The primary user view interacts with a M-F calendar for the week where they are able to organize their to-dos. New to-dos are created from a new to-do form, where they can then be immediately placed on the schedule or onto a responsive side-page that holds unscheduled items.
