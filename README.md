## About

Do Date is a new envisioning of the todo application loosely inspired by Kanban boards. In contrast to the traditional list-based todo app, Do Date allows the user to organize their todo items across the work week. This way the user can easily plot out 'when' the ideal time would be to work based on 'what' the work is and 'how long' the work might take. 

The primary user-view features an interactive Monday-Sunday calendar of the week from which users organize their todos by simply dragging them around and dropping them where they would like on the calendar. New todos are created from a new-todo form, where they can then be immediately placed onto the left responsive side-menu that holds unscheduled items, or directly onto an open space of the calendar. Once the user has completed the task, they move the item to the "Done" right responsive side-menu. Overall, this procedure provides the user an intutive left-to-right workflow: left-unscheduled/center-scheduled/right-done.
